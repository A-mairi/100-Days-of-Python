# 100 Days of Python üêç

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python** journey! This repository is dedicated to documenting my progress as I work through the **100 Days of Python** course by Angela Yu on Udemy.

If you would like an overview about the course, go [here](overview.md).


## About the Course üéì

The **100 Days of Python** course by Angela Yu is a comprehensive, project-based Python bootcamp designed to take beginners to a professional level. The course covers a wide range of topics, including:

- Python Basics & Fundamentals
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Web Development with Flask
- Working with APIs
- Data Science & Machine Learning
- Automation with Python
- Game Development
- and much more!

## My Progress üöÄ

I'll be uploading my work and projects from each day of the course to this repository. You can follow along with my progress, see my code, and even try out the projects yourself!

- **Day 1-5:** Python Basics & Working with Variables
- **Day 6-10:** Functions, Loops, and Data Structures
- **Day 11-15:** Working with APIs and Web Scraping
- (‚Ä¶and so on)

## How to Use This Repository üìÇ

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific day or project from the course. Inside each folder, you'll find:

- **Code files (.py):** The Python scripts I wrote for that day's exercises and projects.
- **README.md:** A brief overview of what I learned or accomplished on that day.

Feel free to explore the code, clone the repository, and try out the projects yourself. If you're also taking the course, I'd love to hear about your progress!
