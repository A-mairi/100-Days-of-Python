# Day 3: Control Flow and Logical Operators 🗺️

Welcome to Day 3 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I explored control flow and logical operators. 

Here’s what I practiced:

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. Control Flow with if / else and Conditional Operators 🔄
Learned to direct the flow of a program using `if`, `else`, and conditional operators.

### 2. Modulo Operator `%` 🔢
Used the modulo operator to find the remainder of division operations.

### 3. Nested if Statements and elif Statements 🔍
Implemented nested `if` statements and `elif` to handle complex conditions.

### 4. Multiple If Statements in Succession 📊
Worked with multiple `if` statements to evaluate various conditions independently.

### 5. Logical Operators 🧩
Utilized logical operators such as `and`, `or`, and `not` to combine multiple conditions.
