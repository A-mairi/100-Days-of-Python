# Day 3: Control Flow and Logical Operators 🗺️

Welcome to Day 3 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I explored control flow and logical operators. 

Here’s what I practiced:

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. Control Flow with if / else and Conditional Operators 🔄
Learned to direct the flow of a program using `if`, `else`, and conditional operators.

### 2. Modulo Operator `%` 🔢
Used the modulo operator to find the remainder of division operations.

### 3. Nested if Statements and elif Statements 🔍
Implemented nested `if` statements and `elif` to handle complex conditions.

### 4. Multiple If Statements in Succession 📊
Worked with multiple `if` statements to evaluate various conditions independently.

### 5. Logical Operators 🧩
Utilized logical operators such as `and`, `or`, and `not` to combine multiple conditions.

## Day 03 Projects

A simulation to help users place pizza orders with options for different toppings and sizes.

### 2. [Rollercoaster Ticket Shop](Rollercoaster-ticket-shop.py) 🎢
A ticketing system for a rollercoaster ride, calculating the price based on user input like age and height.

### 3. [Treasure Island](Treasure-Island-Project.py) 🏝️
A text-based adventure game where players make decisions to navigate through an island and find hidden treasure.

### 4. [Love Calculator](Love-calculator-project.py) ❤️
A fun script to calculate a compatibility score based on names, using various logic operations.
