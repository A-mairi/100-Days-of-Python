# Day 10: Functions with Outputs 🖥️

Welcome to Day 10 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I dived into functions with outputs and worked on building a calculator. 

Here’s what I practiced:

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. Functions with Outputs 🔄
Learned how to define and use functions that return values, enabling more complex and reusable code.

### 2. Multiple Return Values 🧩
Explored how functions can return multiple values, allowing for more flexibility in data handling.

### 3. Docstrings 📝
Practiced writing docstrings to document functions, making code more understandable and maintainable.

### 4. Combining Dictionaries and Functions 📚➕🔄
Combined the use of dictionaries with functions to manage and manipulate data efficiently.

### 5. Print vs. Return 🖨️ vs. ↩️
Understood the difference between using `print` and `return` in functions, learning when to use each appropriately.

### 6. While Loops, Flags, and Recursion 🔄
Explored advanced control flow techniques, including while loops with flags and using recursion for repetitive tasks.

## Day 10 Project: Calculator 🧮

For Day 10, I created a **Calculator** program. This project allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, using functions to return results and handle multiple calculations in a single session.
