# Day 6: Python Functions & Karel 🤖

Welcome to Day 6 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I focused on Python functions, proper indentation, and loops, all while working with Karel the robot. 

Here’s what I learned:

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. Defining and Calling Python Functions 📞
Learned how to define reusable functions in Python and how to call them within a program.

### 2. Indentation in Python 📝
Practiced proper indentation techniques, which are crucial for structuring code and ensuring it runs correctly.

### 3. While Loops 🔁
Explored the use of `while` loops to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true.

## Day 06 Project: Reeborg's World Maze 🌐

For Day 6, I tackled the **Reeborg's World maze**. This project involved guiding Reeborg, a virtual robot, through a maze using Python functions and loops.

Here is a Preview:
