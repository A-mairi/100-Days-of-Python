# Day 9: Dictionaries, Nesting, and the Secret Auction 🗃️

Welcome to Day 9 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I focused on dictionaries, nesting, and built a Blind Auction program. 

Here’s what I practiced:

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. The Python Dictionary 📚
Learned how to create and use Python dictionaries to store and manage data with key-value pairs.

### 2. Nesting Lists and Dictionaries 🗂️
Explored how to nest lists within dictionaries and dictionaries within lists to handle more complex data structures.

## Day 09 Project: Blind Auction 💰

For Day 9, I created a **Blind Auction** program. This project allows multiple users to place secret bids, and at the end, it reveals the highest bidder without disclosing other bids.

Here is a Preview:
