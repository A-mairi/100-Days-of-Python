# Day 19: Instances, State, and Higher Order Functions 🐢🎮

Welcome to Day 19 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I explored advanced concepts such as object instances, state management, and higher-order functions in Python. 

Here’s what I practiced:

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. Python Higher Order Functions & Event Listeners 📡
Learned how to use higher-order functions, which can take other functions as arguments, and applied event listeners to capture user inputs and trigger actions.

### 2. Object State and Instances 📦
Explored how objects in Python maintain internal state and how instances of classes represent unique objects with their own state and behavior.

### 3. The Turtle Coordinate System 🐢
Used Turtle Graphics to understand the Cartesian coordinate system, allowing precise control over the movement and positioning of objects on the screen.

## Day 19 Projects

### 1. Etch-a-Sketch 🎨
Created an **Etch-a-Sketch** program where users can control the Turtle to draw on the screen using keyboard inputs, mimicking the classic toy.

### 2. Turtle Racing Game 🏁
Developed a **Turtle Racing Game**, simulating a race between turtles with random movements. Users can bet on which turtle will win the race, adding an interactive element.
