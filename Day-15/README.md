# Day 15: Local Development Environment Setup & the Coffee Machine ‚òïÔ∏è

Welcome to Day 15 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I focused on setting up a local development environment and worked on building a Coffee Machine project.

Here‚Äôs an overview:

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. Local Development Environment Setup üõ†Ô∏è
Set up my local development environment, configuring tools and settings to create an efficient workflow for Python development.

## Day 15 Project: Coffee Machine ‚òïÔ∏è

For Day 15, I created a [**Coffee Machine**](Coffee_Machine_Project.py) program. This project simulates a coffee machine that allows users to select different types of coffee, handles transactions, and manages resources like water, milk, and coffee beans.
