# Day 4: Randomisation and Python Lists 🎲

Welcome to Day 4 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I focused on randomisation and working with Python lists.

Here’s what I explored:

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. Random Module 🎲
Learned how to use the `random` module to generate random numbers and make random choices.

### 2. Understanding the Offset and Appending Items to Lists 📋
Practiced appending items to lists and understood list offsets and indexing.

### 3. Index Errors and Working with Nested Lists ⚠️
Handled index errors and worked with nested lists for more complex data structures.

## Day 04 Projects

### 1. [Coin Flip Project](Coin-Flip-Project.py) 
Created a simple simulation of a coin flip, where the result is randomly determined to be either heads or tails.

### 2. [Banker's Roulette Project](Banker-Roulette-Project.py) 🎰
Developed a basic roulette game to simulate a random number generation and betting system.

### 3. [Rock Paper Scissors Game](Rock-Paper-Scissors-project.py) ✊🖐️✌️
Built a classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game where users can play against the computer.
