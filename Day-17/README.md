# Day 17: The Quiz Project & The Benefits of OOP 🧠📚

Welcome to Day 17 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I built a quiz game using Object Oriented Programming (OOP), diving deeper into the benefits of OOP in Python. 

Here’s what I practiced:

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. Creating a Class in Python 🏗️
Learned how to define a class in Python to represent entities and model real-world scenarios.

### 2. Working with Attributes, Class Constructors, and the `__init__()` Function ⚙️
Explored how to define attributes for a class and use the `__init__()` function (constructor) to initialize class instances with specific values.

### 3. Adding Methods to a Class 🔄
Practiced adding methods (functions inside a class) to perform actions on the objects, enhancing the functionality of the class.

## Day 17 Project: Quiz Project 📝

For Day 17, I created a **Quiz Project** that allows users to answer a series of questions and keeps track of their score. The project applies OOP concepts by using classes to model questions and the quiz itself, making the code modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.
