# Day 16: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) & the Coffee Machine ☕️🔧

Welcome to Day 16 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I dove into the world of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and built an OOP-based Coffee Machine. 

Here’s what I practiced:

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. Classes and Objects 🏗️
Learned how to create classes and instantiate objects in Python to model real-world entities.

### 2. Constructing Objects and Accessing Attributes and Methods ⚙️
Practiced building objects from classes and learned how to access their attributes and methods to perform tasks.

### 3. Adding Python Packages and Using PyPi 📦
Explored how to install and use external Python packages from PyPi to enhance project functionality.

### 4. Modifying Object Attributes and Calling Methods 🔄
Understood how to modify object attributes dynamically and call methods to perform operations on the objects.

## Day 16 Project: OOP Coffee Machine ☕️

For Day 16, I enhanced the Coffee Machine project using **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. 
The OOP Coffee Machine project simulates a real coffee machine using classes to manage the coffee machine’s attributes (e.g., water, milk, coffee) and methods to handle the processes of selecting drinks, managing resources, and handling transactions.
