# Day 5: Python Loops 🔄

Welcome to Day 5 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I delved into Python loops and their applications. 

Here’s what I practiced:

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. Using the `for` Loop with Python Lists 📋
Learned how to iterate over lists using the `for` loop, allowing for efficient data processing.

### 2. `for` Loops and the `range()` Function ⏳
Explored how to use the `range()` function with `for` loops to generate sequences of numbers for looping.

## Day 05 Project: Password Generator 🔐

For Day 5, I created a [**Password Generator**](Password-Generator-Project.py). This script generates a random password based on user-specified criteria such as length and character types.

Here is a Preview:
