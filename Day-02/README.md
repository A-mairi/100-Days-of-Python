# Day 2: Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings 🧩

Welcome to Day 2 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I delved into Python data types and string manipulation. 

Here’s what I covered:

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. Python Primitive Data Types 🔢
Explored Python's basic data types, including integers, floats, and strings.

### 2. Type Error, Type Checking, and Type Conversion ⚠️
Learned about type errors, how to check types, and how to convert between different data types.

### 3. Data Types 📊
Deepened understanding of various data types and their characteristics.

### 4. Mathematical Operations in Python ➕➖✖️➗
Practiced performing mathematical operations and calculations.

### 5. Number Manipulation and F-Strings in Python 🔄🧵
Manipulated numbers and used f-strings for string formatting and interpolation.

## Day 02 Project: Tip Calculator 💸

For Day 2, I created a [**Tip Calculator**](Tip-Calculator-Project.py). This Python script calculates the amount of tip to be given based on user input for the bill amount and the desired tip percentage.
