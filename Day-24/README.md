# Day 24: Files, Directories, and Paths 📁📂

Welcome to Day 24 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I focused on how to work with files, directories, and paths in Python. 

Here’s what I practiced:

## Concepts Practised

### 1. Opening, Reading, and Writing to Files using the "with" Keyword 📝
Learned how to open, read, and write to files efficiently using Python’s `with` keyword, ensuring that files are properly closed after being processed.

### 2. Relative and Absolute File Paths 🛤️
Explored how to navigate and work with both **relative** and **absolute file paths**, essential for managing files in different directories and locations.

### 3. Adding a High Score to the Snake Game 🐍🏆
Enhanced the **Snake Game** by adding a feature that saves the player’s high score to a file, allowing the high score to persist even after the game is closed and restarted.

## Day 24 Project: Mail Merge ✉️

For Day 24, I built a **Mail Merge** project, which takes a list of names and customizes a message for each individual. This project demonstrates file handling by reading from files, manipulating their contents, and generating new personalized messages.
