# Day 18: Turtle Graphics & Graphical User Interface (GUI) 🎨🐢

Welcome to Day 18 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I explored Turtle Graphics and learned how to create graphical applications using Python.

Here’s what I practiced:

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. Understanding Turtle Graphics and Using Documentation 📖
Learned how to use the Turtle graphics library to create visual drawings and understood how to navigate documentation effectively.

### 2. Importing Modules, Installing Packages, and Working with Aliases 📦
Practiced importing modules, installing external packages, and using aliases to simplify code and improve readability.

### 3. Python Tuples and Generating Random RGB Colours 🌈
Explored Python tuples and used them to represent color values in the form of RGB, generating random colors for graphical designs.

## Day 18 Project: The Hirst Painting Project 🎨

For Day 18, I created **The Hirst Painting Project**. This project uses Turtle Graphics to recreate a piece of art inspired by the famous artist Damien Hirst. The program generates random colored dots in a grid pattern, mimicking a pointillism painting style.
