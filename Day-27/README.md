# Day 27: Tkinter, *args, **kwargs, and Creating GUI Programs 🖥️🧩

Welcome to Day 27 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I explored **Tkinter** for creating **GUI** (Graphical User Interface) applications and learned how to handle variable-length argument lists in Python.

Here’s what I practiced:

## Concepts Practised

### 1. Creating Windows and Labels with Tkinter 🖼️
Learned how to create a **GUI window** and display **labels** using the Tkinter library, which provides a way to create desktop applications.

### 2. Setting Default Values for Optional Arguments 🌟
Discovered how to use default values for optional function parameters to make functions more flexible.

### 3. Working with *args and **kwargs ⚙️
Practiced using **`*args`** to pass a variable number of positional arguments, and **`**kwargs`** to handle keyword arguments dynamically inside a function.

### 4. Buttons, Entry, and Setting Component Options 🔲
Built interactive elements like **buttons** and **entry fields** with Tkinter, and learned how to configure their options dynamically.

### 5. Other Tkinter Widgets 🧩
Worked with additional Tkinter widgets such as **Radiobuttons**, **Scales**, **Checkbuttons**, and more to expand the GUI functionality.

### 6. Tkinter Layout Managers: pack(), place(), and grid() 📏
Practiced using **layout managers** in Tkinter, including **pack()**, **place()**, and **grid()** to organize widgets within the GUI.

## Day 27 Project: Miles to Kilometers Converter 🛣️➡️📏

For Day 27, I created a **Miles to Kilometers Converter**, a simple GUI application that allows users to input a distance in miles and converts it into kilometers. This project combines **Tkinter** with the concepts of **optional arguments** and **component layout** to create a user-friendly interface.
