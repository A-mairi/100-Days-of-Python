# Day 1: Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data 🐍

Welcome to Day 1 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I focused on the fundamentals of Python programming, specifically on managing data using variables. 

Here’s what I covered:

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. Printing to the Console 📟
Learned how to use the `print()` function to display information and results to the console.

### 2. String Manipulation ✂️
Explored how to manipulate strings, including concatenation and formatting.

### 3. Debugging 🐞
Practiced basic debugging techniques to identify and fix issues in the code.

### 4. The Python Input Function ⌨️
Utilized the `input()` function to take user input and integrate it into programs.

### 5. Python Variables 📦
Introduced to variables in Python, including how to declare and use them to store data.

### 6. Variable Naming 🏷️
Discussed best practices for naming variables, including naming conventions and avoiding common pitfalls.

## Day 01 Project: Band Name Generator 🎸

For Day 1, I worked on a project to create a [**Band Name Generator**](Band-Name-Generator-Project.py). This project applies the concepts learned today to generate creative band names based on user input.
