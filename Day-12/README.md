# Day 12: Scope & Number Guessing Game 🔢

Welcome to Day 12 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I explored variable scope in Python and built an engaging Number Guessing Game. 

Here’s what I practiced:

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. How to Modify a Global Variable 🌐
Learned how to modify global variables within functions and understand the implications of using global scope.

### 2. Python Constants and Global Scope 📏
Practiced defining and using constants in Python, and explored the concept of global scope for managing variables across different parts of a program.

## Day 12 Project: The Number Guessing Game 🎲

For Day 12, I created [**The Number Guessing Game**](Number_Guessing_Project.py). This project challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range, with the game providing hints based on their guesses.

Here is a Preview:
