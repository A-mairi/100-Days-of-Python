# Day 25: Working with CSV Data and the Pandas Library 📊🐼

Welcome to Day 25 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I learned how to work with CSV data and explored the **Pandas** library, which is essential for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

Here’s what I practiced:

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. Reading CSV Data in Python 🗃️
Learned how to read and process **CSV** files using both built-in Python methods and the **Pandas** library to handle large datasets efficiently.

### 2. DataFrames & Series in Pandas 🧮
Discovered how to work with **DataFrames** and **Series**, the two main data structures in Pandas, for organizing and manipulating structured data.

### 3. Working with Rows & Columns 📝
Practiced selecting, filtering, and manipulating data by working with specific rows and columns in a **DataFrame** to extract meaningful insights.

### 4. Data Analysis with Pandas 📈
Used Pandas functions to perform basic data analysis, including summarizing, filtering, and grouping data for more complex analysis.

## Day 25 Project: US States Guessing Game 🗺️

For Day 25, I built a **US States Guessing Game**, where the player tries to guess the names of all 50 US states. The game uses a **CSV file** containing state data and employs **Pandas** for handling and analyzing the guesses.
