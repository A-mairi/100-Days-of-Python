# Day 22: Build Pong - The Famous Arcade Game 🕹️🏓

Welcome to Day 22 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I built the classic **Pong game**, one of the most famous arcade games of all time. 

Here’s what I practiced:

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. Creating a Paddle that Responds to Key Presses ⌨️
Built a responsive paddle that moves up and down based on keypresses, allowing for smooth gameplay interaction.

### 2. Writing the Paddle Class and Creating the Second Paddle 🏓
Used Object Oriented Programming to define a **Paddle** class, and then created both paddles, one for each player.

### 3. Writing the Ball Class and Making the Ball Move ⚽
Implemented a **Ball** class to handle the movement of the ball across the screen, simulating realistic physics and ball motion.

### 4. Adding Ball Bouncing Logic 🔄
Learned how to implement ball bouncing, making the ball change direction when it hits a paddle or the top/bottom borders of the game window.

### 5. Detecting Collisions with the Paddle 🎯
Programmed collision detection so the ball knows when it hits a paddle, ensuring that gameplay continues smoothly.

### 6. Detecting when the Ball Goes Out of Bounds 🚫
Added logic to detect when the ball goes out of bounds, resetting the game and updating the score for the appropriate player.

### 7. Score Keeping and Changing Ball Speed 🏆
Implemented a scorekeeping system and increased the ball’s speed to make the game progressively more challenging as the players continue to score.

## Day 22 Project: Pong Game 🕹️

For Day 22, I recreated the classic **Pong Game** with full functionality, including paddles, a moving ball, collision detection, scorekeeping, and increasing ball speed for added difficulty.
