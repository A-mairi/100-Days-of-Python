# Day 8: Function Parameters & Caesar Cipher 🔐

Welcome to Day 8 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I explored function parameters and worked on the Caesar Cipher project. Here’s what I practiced:

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. Functions with Inputs 📥
Learned how to define and use functions with input parameters to make them more dynamic and reusable.

### 2. Positional vs. Keyword Arguments 📌
Explored the differences between positional and keyword arguments, understanding how to use each effectively in function calls.

## Day 08 Project: Caesar Cipher 🗝️

For Day 8, I created a [**Caesar Cipher**](Caesar_Cipher_Project.py) program. This classic encryption technique shifts the letters in a message by a fixed number of positions, encoding and decoding text based on user input.

Here is a Preview:
