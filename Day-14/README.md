# Day 14: Higher Lower Game Project 🔼🔽

Welcome to Day 14 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I worked on building the Higher Lower Game, applying concepts related to dictionaries, procedures, and conditional statements. 

Here’s what I practiced:

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. Using Dictionary Data 📚
Learned how to effectively store and retrieve data using dictionaries in Python.

### 2. Using Procedures 🔄
Practiced breaking down tasks into procedures, creating reusable code blocks to streamline the game logic.

### 3. Using Conditional Statements 🛤️
Applied conditional statements to control the flow of the game based on user input and comparisons.

## Day 14 Project: Higher Lower Game 🎮

For Day 14, I created the [**Higher Lower Game**](Higher_Or_Lower_Project.py). This game challenges players to compare two items and guess which one has a higher value based on the provided data.

Here is a Preview:
