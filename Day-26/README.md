# Day 26: List Comprehension and the NATO Alphabet 📝🔤

Welcome to Day 26 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I dived into **List Comprehension** and **Dictionary Comprehension** to make data manipulation easier and more concise.

Here’s what I practiced:

## Concepts Practised

### 1. Creating Lists using List Comprehension 📋
Learned how to generate lists efficiently using **List Comprehension**, making code more readable and reducing the need for traditional loops.

### 2. Using Dictionary Comprehension 📖
Explored **Dictionary Comprehension** to create dictionaries in a concise way, further optimizing data structure creation.

### 3. Iterating over a Pandas DataFrame 🐼
Practiced looping through rows in a **Pandas DataFrame** to manipulate or extract specific information easily.

## Day 26 Project: NATO Alphabet Project 🔤

For Day 26, I created a [**NATO Alphabet Project**](main.py), where users input a word, and the program returns the corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet for each letter. The project utilizes **List Comprehension** and a **Pandas DataFrame** to map letters to their phonetic codewords.
