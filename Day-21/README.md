# Day 21: Build the Snake Game Part 2: Inheritance & List Slicing 🐍🔪

Welcome to Day 21 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I continued working on the Snake Game, focusing on class inheritance and list slicing to enhance the game’s functionality. 

Here’s what I practiced:

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. Class Inheritance 🏗️
Learned how to implement **class inheritance** in Python, allowing one class to inherit methods and attributes from another class, which makes the code more reusable and modular.

### 2. Slicing Lists & Tuples 🔪
Practiced **list slicing** to efficiently access and manipulate portions of lists and tuples, which is particularly useful when handling the snake’s body segments.

## Day 21 Project: Snake Game Part 2 🐍

For Day 21, I enhanced the **Snake Game** by applying inheritance and slicing techniques to improve the structure and functionality of the snake’s movement and interactions. The game now features a more efficient codebase and is ready for further development.
