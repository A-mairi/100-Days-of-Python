# Day 13: Debugging - How to Find and Fix Errors in Your Code 🐛🔍

Welcome to Day 13 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I focused on debugging techniques to find and fix errors in code. 

Here’s what I practiced:

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. Describing the Problem 📝
Learned how to clearly describe the issue at hand to better understand and address the problem.

### 2. Reproducing the Bug 🔄
Practiced reproducing the bug to observe its behavior and identify potential causes.

### 3. Playing Computer and Evaluating Each Line 💻
Adopted the mindset of the computer to manually trace through code, evaluating each line to spot errors.

### 4. Squashing Bugs with a `print()` Statement 🐞
Used `print()` statements strategically to display variable values and understand where things might be going wrong.

### 5. Using a Debugger 🛠️
Explored how to use a debugger to set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variable states.

## Debugged Projects

### 1. Odd or Even 🔢
Debugged a script that determines if a number is odd or even.

### 2. Leap Year 🌟
Fixed issues in a program that checks if a year is a leap year.

### 3. FizzBuzz 🎉
Resolved bugs in the FizzBuzz program, which prints numbers from 1 to 100 with specific substitutions.
