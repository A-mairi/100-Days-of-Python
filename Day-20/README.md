# Day 20: Build the Snake Game Part 1: Animation & Coordinates 🐍🎮

Welcome to Day 20 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I started building the classic Snake Game, focusing on animation and handling coordinates. 

Here’s what I practiced:

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. Screen Setup and Creating a Snake Body 📺
Set up the game screen and created the initial snake body using Turtle Graphics, understanding how to work with multiple snake segments.

### 2. Animating the Snake Segments on Screen 🎞️
Learned how to animate the snake by moving its segments in sync, creating a continuous movement effect.

### 3. Create a Snake Class & Move to OOP 🏗️
Implemented Object Oriented Programming (OOP) by creating a **Snake** class, encapsulating all the functionality needed to move the snake and manage its behavior.

### 4. Controlling the Snake with Keypress ⌨️
Added keyboard controls to move the snake in different directions using arrow key inputs.

## Day 20 Project: Snake Game Part 1 🐍

For Day 20, I built the first part of the **Snake Game**. In this part, the snake is animated and can be controlled with the keyboard, laying the foundation for a fully functioning game in the upcoming days.

Here is a Preview:
