# Day 23: The Turtle Crossing Capstone Project 🐢🚗

Welcome to Day 23 of my **100 Days of Python** journey! Today, I tackled the **Turtle Crossing Capstone Project**, where the goal is to guide a turtle across a road filled with moving cars.

Here’s what I practiced:

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. Creating a Turtle that Responds to Key Presses 🐢⌨️
Built a responsive turtle that moves up the screen when the user presses a key, simulating the turtle trying to cross the road.

### 2. Writing the Car Class and Randomly Spawning Cars 🚗
Used Object Oriented Programming to define a **Car** class and randomly spawned cars at different intervals to make the crossing challenging.

### 3. Detecting Collisions with the Cars 🎯
Implemented collision detection to end the game if the turtle collides with a car, adding a level of difficulty.

### 4. Detecting when the Turtle Crosses Successfully 🏆
Added logic to detect when the turtle reaches the other side of the road safely, which results in the player winning and advancing to the next level.

### 5. Score Keeping and Changing the Car Speed ⚡
Kept track of the player's score and increased the speed of the cars with each successful crossing, making the game progressively harder.

## Day 23 Project: Turtle Crossing 🐢🚗

For Day 23, I created the [**Turtle Crossing**](main.py) game, where the player must help the turtle cross a busy road while avoiding collisions with cars. The game features scorekeeping and increases in difficulty as the player progresses.

Here is a Preview:
